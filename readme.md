The webmods more or less just makes certain sites more theme-friendly.

Sites currently included:

- Twitter (complete, to my knowledge)
- cppreference (complete, to my knowledge)
- zyBooks (incomplete)
- Google (quite incomplete)
- ALEKS (extremely incomplete)

Sites with webmods planned:

- MDN docs
- Github
- learn.microsoft.com
- YouTube

Feel free to give me any suggestions you have or problems you encounter!
If you find an issue with the incomplete sites, it's likely I already know and am working on them. But it would be very helpful if you can let me know about any issues you find in the sites marked as complete.

Thank you! I hope you enjoy! ^w^
