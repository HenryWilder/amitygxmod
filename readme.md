[^1]: Status of "complete" does not mean I won't work on it further if bugs are brought to my attention.

Feel free to give me any suggestions you have or problems you encounter!
If you find an issue with the incomplete sites, it's likely I already know and am working on them. But it would be very helpful if you can let me know about any issues you find in the sites marked as complete.

Thank you! I hope you enjoy! ^w^
